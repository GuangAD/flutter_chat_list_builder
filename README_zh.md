一个用于构建聊天信息列表的flutter package

这个包不负责气泡的样式，它只负责列表的滚动行为。

## Features

- 向下滚动加载历史记录
- 添加新消息
- 当不处于列表最下面时，添加新消息保持当前阅读位置不变

## Getting started

```dart
import 'package:flutter_chat_list_builder/flutter_chat_list_builder.dart';
```

## Usage

TODO: Include short and useful examples for package users. Add longer examples
to `/example` folder. 

```dart
const like = 'sample';
```

## Additional information

TODO: Tell users more about the package: where to find more information, how to 
contribute to the package, how to file issues, what response they can expect 
from the package authors, and more.
